### OpenAI Chatbot

The API request to OpenAI's ChatGPT is functional, but is not working at the moment due to account limitations. The requesets from diskycordy through my openAI account are rate limited, which blocks requests to the server. The only solution is switching to a premium plan. Unfortunately, due to financial constraints, I'm unable to subscribe to a premium plan at the moment. However, it's worth noting that the implementation of AI in the server is already in place and operational, promising an enhanced experience for your server.
